/********************************************************************************
 * ownership.h — SD-card ownership arbitration between the FPGA and the CH569.
 *
 * The card sits behind a physical MUX driven by the FPGA. The CH569 requests
 * the card by driving PB10 high (10K pull-down keeps it low / FPGA-owned at
 * reset) and returns it by driving PB10 low. There is no ACK line back:
 * after asserting PB10 the firmware waits PB10_SETTLE_MS and then (re)inits
 * the card ("assert and proceed", agreed with the client).
 *
 * Requests can arrive from interrupt context (EP0 vendor request) or from the
 * CDC byte stream ('t'); the actual claim/release — which includes a slow SD
 * re-init — only ever runs from ownership_poll() in the main loop, so it can
 * never preempt an in-flight MSC transfer.
